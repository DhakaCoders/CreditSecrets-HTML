              <p>When I was on the inside, I learned every single credit loophole, work around and trick ever invented...</p>
              <p>Some well known and others they would do anything to keep secret.</p>
              <p>I know it sounds crazy, but when you ruffle the feathers of wealthy, powerful, corrupt corporate giants who have billions of dollars on the line, bad things can happen. </p>
              <p>They can't stand whistle blowers and they'd do anything to keep what I'm about to show you from getting in the hands of people like you, who fund their multimillion dollar bonuses every year.</p>
              <p>But I don't care because this is something that's well worth the risk.</p>

                <p>Because of course, everyone knows bad credit will force you to pay higher payments, interest rates, and even get you denied for car or home loan.</p>                
                <p>But did you also know it can keep you from getting a job? </p>
                <p>My own brother recently made it to a final interview for a truck driving job with a big name beer distributor. </p>
                <p>His salary would jump from 40,000 to 60,000 a year. </p>
                <p>This meant everything to him because it would finally allow him to save enough money for his three year old daughter, Madison, to one day go to college.</p>
                <p>But all of a sudden, one morning I woke up to a call from him. He was literally sobbing. </p>
                <p>I'd never heard my brother cry, not in the entire 34 years he's been alive. </p>
                <p>Something had to be very wrong.</p>

                <p>When he calmed down, he began to tell me how the company had run a credit check on him and his score came back as a 644.</p>
                <p>Imagine looking into the innocent faces of your children and having to tell them why they can't go to college…</p>
                <p>Or why you can't get them to a dentist…</p>

                <p>Or why you have to move or where…</p>
                <p>All because of something you could have easily fixed in advance, if only you knew how.</p>
                <p>The bottom line is…</p>
