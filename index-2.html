          <p>What was this loophole? </p>
          <p>Well, you see, what they found buried within the pages of these two laws is quite possibly the most powerful 11-word phrase ever spoken. </p>
          <p><span class="fl-txt-line-bg lazy" data-src="assets/images/fl-txt-line-bg-1.png">These 11 words when used in exactly the right way activate a powerful credit protection</span> <br> <span class="fl-txt-line-bg lazy" data-src="assets/images/fl-txt-line-bg-2.png">mechanism that can instantly stop all the harassing phone calls and rapidly melt away all</span> <span class="fl-txt-line-bg lazy" data-src="assets/images/fl-txt-line-bg-3.png">the bad marks on your report.</span></p>
          <p>All you have to do is use these 11 words correctly and you can literally free yourself from the shackles of bad credit. </p>
          <p>No matter what you've heard about credit repair in the past... </p>
          <p>I can guarantee you it had nothing to do with these magical 11 words…</p>
          <p>Because until now, the secret was known only by a very small group of people on the inside... </p>
          <p>Those who have seen behind the curtain of the credit industry…</p>
          <p>The best part is…</p>

          <p>All that ends today because, you see, about a week after I got back from the conference... </p>
          <p>Scott gave me a call and asked me to show him how all this worked. </p>
          <p>At first he was skeptical, which I totally understood. </p>
          <p>We've all been told by so-called credit help experts they can fix our credit... <br> That is if you pay them a hefty fee... </p>

          <p>So, over the next 60 minutes on the phone I laid out my method for Scott as he took down a few pages of notes. </p>
          <p>He was shocked at how simple it seemed, which made him even more skeptical. </p>
          <p>Just try it out I told him. </p>
          <p>You're about to meet with a bankruptcy lawyer and ruin the next 10 years of your financial life. </p>
          <p>What have you got to lose? </p>
          <p>Well, he couldn't argue with that, so over the next 30 days, he did exactly as I told him. </p>
          <p>He kept me updated on his progress via email. </p>
          <p>Then one day my phone rang.</p>
