            <p>I had brainwashed myself into believing this was okay because it was putting food on my family's table.</p>

          <p>No matter how bad your history is. </p>
          <p>You see, after I escaped the credit industry, I got a job in sales working for an online eCommerce company.</p>
          <p>A few months after I started there, the company flew me out to a conference in San Diego, California. </p>
          <p>One night while I was there, I got to talk with another sales reputation at the hotel lobby bar.</p>
          <p>His name was Scott Hilton, and as we were there chatting and having a few drinks, the topic of my previous job came up.</p>

          <p>We were a bit tipsy now and Scott started telling me something he probably wouldn't normally tell a total stranger.</p>
          <p>What I didn't know at the time, was that this very conversation would change both our lives and the lives of thousands of others forever, including yours.</p>
          <p>He told me the story of how he had moved from Seattle to Hollywood, with hopes of becoming an actor.</p>
          <p>He went to auditions all day, took acting classes at night, but it never worked out as he planned.</p>
          <p>He couldn't land a role, and during this time he ran out of money.</p>
          <p>He was living on his credit cards, so he was forced to give up his dream of becoming an actor.</p>

            <p>The problem was, when the bills came due, there wasn't enough money to pay off the balances he had racked up so he wound up getting deep in debt, and many of his accounts had gone to collections.</p>
            <p>He was living paycheck to paycheck and trying to pay everything off, but the balances just weren't going down no matter what he tried, every time he made a payment, they'd pile on more fees and interest charges.</p> 
            <p>All of the hidden fees that were originally buried in small print were now larger than life.</p>
            <p>It was, literally, killing him to work so hard and be under so much stress.</p> 
            <p>His anxiety got to the point where he could barely even go out in public anymore because his nerves were so shot.</p>
